* Tasks
** TODO Move virtual machine config into nixfiles
virsh edit win10-3, steal the XML, make a service, ...
https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Virtualization_in_NixOS#Okay.2C_Okay.2C_I.27ll_Do_It_Myself

** TODO Add dork.dev to mailserver
Don't want to pay for fastmail.

** TODO Migrate non-PGSQL services to PGSQL
bitwarden-rs, Gitea, ...

** TODO Maybe restructure services away from hosts.
See PBB structure for services/.
https://git.petabyte.dev/petabyteboy/nixfiles/src/branch/main/services/

** TODO Gitea theme + resources overwrite
See PBB/milan gitea.
https://git.petabyte.dev/petabyteboy/nixfiles/src/branch/main/services/gitea/default.nix

** TODO Move network config away from network manager.
network.wireless is good enough. nm-applet doesn't work on Sway anyway.

** TODO Nixfiles working outside of NixOS, e.g. Fedora + macOS
Investigate build module for these systems. See: Investigate nix-darwin.

** TODO Refactor Sway config for separate input/outputs on different systems
Each gui host should have their own sway config.

** TODO Refactor waybar config for separate modules on different systems
Each gui host should have their own waybar config.

** TODO Refactor Sway config for separate wallpapers on different systems as a result of the prior outputs change
Each gui host should have their own sway config.

** TODO Fix function parameter headers
Too many excess unneccessary parameters.

** TODO Syncplay server
Need to do SSL properly. Also set up salt + room passwords.

** TODO Unfuckulate the weechat config
Move to arc's weechat module.
https://github.com/arcnmx/nixexprs/blob/f3f24ef4226a8ff3531d9a3e005c4993ed0d7ba2/modules/home/weechat.nix

* Research

** TODO Investigate nix-darwin
Mostly differences for deployment. Set up a macOS VM. .-.

** TODO Investigate pipewire
Viable yet on NixOS? Probably not on 20.09 itself, but maybe...

** TODO Investigate ncmpcpp
Need to build a music collection.

** TODO Investigate further vimode stuff
Weechat, certainly. Fish vimode enabled.

** TODO Crawl more nixfiles for new things / workflows
arc, milan, ...

** TODO Investigate audio source switching (Arctis 5, integrated front, integrated back)
For arctis 5 to integrated probably paswitch. Rest is output switch.

* Secrets handling

** TODO Bitwarden integration for secrets obtainment
Should be possible. Need to investigate alternate implementation (check arc's... for this)

** TODO Split secrets usage in-store towards private config instead of embedding inside configs using a secrets file
Definitely doable.
